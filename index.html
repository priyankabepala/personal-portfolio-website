            <h3>Project Name:X-Ray-Based Quick COVID-19 Detection With Raspberry Pi
            </h3>
            <p>General X-Ray-based Covid-19 detection systems are fast and give quick results along with the status of how much the COVID-19 virus has infected the lungs. Previous Covid-19 detection systems took time to give reports while the infected person needed immediate attention. Also, all such detection systems used parts that required to be disposed of after every use, creating a high demand for raw materials. 

                But our X-Ray-based Covid-19 detection system needs to be installed only once with an X-Ray machine. The detection system gives a timely status of infection inside the lungs. There are two ways to achieve this: by using the Python library or by creating and training an ML model. Here we talk about first creating and training the ML method. Also published soon will be other methods where we use pre-trained model.</p>

                <h3>Project Name:Smart Receptionist With Smartlock System</h3>
                <p>Presented here is a security system that lets you see a visitor while EFY Testedyour main office door is locked. If you are in the middle of a meeting in a conference room and there is a visitor at the door, this system will send a notification to your smartphone with a photo of the visitor as email. If you approve, you either use your mobile or PC to unlock the front door using a Web browser. Alternatively, if you have a door bell with intercom facility, you can talk to the visitor when he or she rings the door bell. A typical block diagram of the smart receptionist with a smartlock system is shown in figure
